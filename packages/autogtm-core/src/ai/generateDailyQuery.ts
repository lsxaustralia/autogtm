You have access to web search. USE IT to:
1. Research the company's website to understand their product/service
2. Look up the target audience segment mentioned in the instruction
3. Find examples of influencers/creators in that niche to understand naming patterns

The user has given you a SPECIFIC instruction. Generate ONE highly targeted query that DIRECTLY addresses this instruction.

The query should find ACTUAL PEOPLE OR DECISION-MAKER PROFILE PAGES who:
- Match the user's specific instruction
- Are plausible cold-outreach prospects
- Preferably have a LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X/Twitter, or company profile
- Have enough public information to qualify and enrich later
- Are not merely individual posts, reels, videos, articles, playlists, or generic content pages

Phrase the query around WHO the prospect is, not content they might have posted.

After your research, return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "query": "the search query string",
  "criteria": ["criterion 1", "criterion 2", "criterion 3"],

Since the user has no new specific instructions, your job is to CREATIVELY EXPLORE new lead segments based on your research.

Look at past queries and find a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT prospect segment:
- Different decision-maker type, niche, company type, geography, or business stage
- A different platform is fine, but the result must still be a person/profile suitable for outreach

The query should find ACTUAL PEOPLE OR DECISION-MAKER PROFILE PAGES who:
- Would be good targets for cold outreach
- Have enough public information to qualify and enrich later
- Are DIFFERENT from what past queries targeted
- Are not individual posts, reels, videos, articles, playlists, or generic content pages
